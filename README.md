# javascript-calculator
Simple JavaScript calculator based on Odin Project. This was my first JavaScript Project and my first big challenge, as I needed to figure out myself the correct algorithm to solve the problem.
* Didn't use Eval() 
* Algorithm should be fixed
* Has some bugs for complex calculations
